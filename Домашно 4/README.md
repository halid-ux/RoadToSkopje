## Design Patterns

We are using the MVC design pattern pattern in our backend and in our microservices.


## React App
https://skopjeguidedocker.netlify.app/
Alternative - http://20.61.35.101/

The React application is deployed on the Netlify CDN and it communicates with the API deployed on a Docker Container.

## Spring Boot API Endpoints

The Spring Boot API is deployed on Docker Server behind an NGINX proxy server running on Ubuntu 18.04.

The restaurants microservice in the microservices folder sits behind the same NGINX proxy and is deployed on a Docker container.

The skopjeguidesearch microservice is configured to be deployed on a Docker container.
